      <div class="paragraph"><p>Opel Automobile GmbH, or simply Opel, is a German automobile manufacturer. From 1929 until 2017, Opel was owned by the American automaker General Motors. After separating from General Motors, Opel became part of the Group PSA in 2017. On January 16, 2021, it joined the Stellantis automotive company formed by the merger of Groupe PSA and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Opel vehicles are sold under the Vauxhall brand in the United Kingdom. Some Opel vehicles are produced under the Holden brand in Australia, and under the Buick brand in North America and China.

        Opel was founded in 1862 in Rüsselsheim by Adam Opel as a sewing machine manufacturer. The company started bicycle production in 1886 and produced its first car in 1899. After being listed on the stock exchange in 1929, General Motors acquired a majority stake in Opel, and then took over full control of the company in 1931. Thus began the 90-year control over the brand.
        
        Following the merger of Groupe PSA and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles to form Stellantis, the company became Europe's most valuable automotive company, taking this title from Volkswagen.
        
        Opel's headquarters is located in the city of Rüsselsheim in the German state of Hesse. The company designs, manufactures, and distributes passenger cars, light commercial vehicles, and vehicle parts under the Opel brand. Together with its British sister brand Vauxhall, they operate in more than 60 countries worldwide.</p></div>
